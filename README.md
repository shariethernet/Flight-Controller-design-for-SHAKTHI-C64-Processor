# Flight-Controller-design-for-SHAKTHI-C64-Processor
 This is a SIMULINK based Control System Design for a Quadcopter. The Control System  was designed in SIMULINK and the Embedded C Code and Verilog code were generated using SIMULINK Coder. This was aimed at developing a flight controller using the RISCV ISA based SHAKTHI-C64-Vajra Microprocessor developed a RISE Labs, IIT Madras, India
